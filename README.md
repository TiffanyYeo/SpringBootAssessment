## What did you like about this project?
Nice experiece to be able to work on database and a good practice to get familiar of the steps for final project preparation.
## What did you struggle with in this project?
Understanding the many codes used and the various links that affect the program to run.
## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Still think this whole learning should be stretched a longer period such as 3-4 weeks at least. So to better understand the coding and the framwork structure. Honestly, it is very much of c&p and modify from there. If we can have enough time to learn the fundamental and gain the ability to write the whole code independently and confidently.
